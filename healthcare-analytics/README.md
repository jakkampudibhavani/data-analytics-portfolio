## CMS Hospital Readmissions Analysis (HRRP)

### Overview
This project analyzes CMS Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP) data to identify
high-risk conditions, state-level performance trends, and hospitals exceeding CMS benchmarks.

### Tools Used
- SQL Server
- Python (Pandas)
- Power BI
- Excel

### Project Workflow
1. Explored and validated CMS HRRP data in Excel
2. Cleaned and transformed data using SQL Server
3. Performed exploratory analysis and validation in Python
4. Built an interactive Power BI dashboard for insights and storytelling

###  How to Run
- SQL: Execute scripts in the `/sql` folder on SQL Server
- Python: Run the Jupyter notebook in `/python`
- Power BI: Open `HRRP_Dashboard.pbix` in Power BI Desktop



### Key Analyses
- Condition-level excess readmission comparison
- State-level performance vs CMS benchmark
- Impact of low discharge volume on readmission metrics

### Key Insights
- Hip/Knee replacement and COPD show higher excess readmission ratios
- Several states consistently exceed CMS benchmarks
- Low-volume hospitals exhibit higher variability
